    PSP uses the concept of a "Security Association" (SA) to represent the set of traffic to be
    handled with a particular set of crypto state (keys, IVs, sequence numbers, etc.). An SA is
    always unidirectional (simplex).

    An SA defines a grouping of packets that are treated identically from an encryption and an
    authentication standpoint. An SA can be any granularity ranging from individual TCP
    connections to VM-to-VM tunnels aggregating all traffic between a pair of VMs. Configuration
    of an SA includes:
    - SPI (Security Parameters Index)
    - Encryption key (stored on the sending side; derived on the receiver side)
    - Crypt Offset specifying the amount of packet after the IV allowed to be cleartext (but still
    authenticated) when operating in AES-GCM mode
    - Traffic flow confidentiality configuration (TFC using the techniques described for IPSec)
    - Lifetime of the SA (requirements for when it must be destroyed)
