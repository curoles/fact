    In computer networking, a flit (flow control unit or flow control digit) is a link-level atomic piece
    that forms a network packet or stream. The first flit, called the header flit holds information about
    this packet's route (namely the destination address) and sets up the routing behavior for all subsequent
    flits associated with the packet. The header flit is followed by zero or more body flits,
    containing the actual payload of data. The final flit, called the tail flit, performs some book keeping
    to close the connection between the two nodes.
