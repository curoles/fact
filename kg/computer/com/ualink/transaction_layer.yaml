    The Transaction Layer (TL) shall connect to two UPLI Interfaces, one sourced from
    a UPLI Originator and one sourced from a UPLI Completer. The TL shall drive a 64-byte Outbound
    Transmit (Tx) Flit to the UALink DL and shall receive from the UALink DL a 64-byte Inbound
    Receive (Rx) Flit from the UALink DL. The UPLI channels driven into the TL from both UPLI
    interfaces shall be packaged into 64-byte Outbound Transmit (Tx) Flit which shall be transmitted to
    the UALink DL. Similarly, the Receive (Rx) 64-byte TL Flit from the UALink DL shall be unpacked
    into Request, Read Response/Data, Orig Data, and Write Response channels for the two attached
    UPLI Interfaces.
